I am currently a graduate student at Cornell University studying Operations Research and Information Engineering. I got my bachelor's degree at St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN. I double majored in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

My study focus is data mining and machine learning. I love data and believe in the power of data. I am graduating in May 2022 and am seeking for a full-time job of data scientist and data analyst.
